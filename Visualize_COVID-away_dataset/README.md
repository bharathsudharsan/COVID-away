As described, there are 2071 data patterns for various hand-to-face motion recorded in the COVID-away dataset. 
To visualize these patterns (one by one), unzip the dataset in its same directory, then run this program using; "python visualize_data_patterns_in_COVID-away.py".
Then enter any number between 0 - 2071, to obtain the visualization of that respective data pattern. 
For example, I have visualized data patterns 0, 50, 400, 600, 1971, and saved the resulting images here.

If you are missing some libraries, install them using the pip installer.
