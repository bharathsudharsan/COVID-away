## COVID-away: A Hand-to-face 3D Motion Dataset and Trained Models

This repo contains: 

1. COVID-away dataset: We record, fuse, and provide 3D multi-sensor data for 2071 dynamic hand-to-face movements, performed with various postures & wrist orientations.
2. We provide a generic feature extractor for enabling users to extract 10 essential features from a single data field in any sensor-based motion dataset. Using this, we compute 102 features for each recorded hand-to-face motion data pattern.
3. COVID-away Models: We provide one-class classification models and a CNN trained using the features extracted from our COVID-away Dataset. Our models instantly warn the users when their hands are moved (un-intentionally) to the face.
